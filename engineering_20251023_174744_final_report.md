**3. Model Performance Analysis**

**Overall Summary:** The model shows good performance with high accuracy (99.9%)

**Key Insights:**
- Insight 1: The model achieves high accuracy due to its ability to effectively capture the underlying relationship between input and output variables.
- Insight 2: While the model has a high accuracy, it has a low precision (0.1%) and a high false positive rate (0.05%). This indicates that the model tends to classify positive cases incorrectly.
- Insight 3: The PR curve indicates that the model has a good ability to balance precision and recall, resulting in a high F1 score of 0.95. This suggests that the model performs well in both minimizing false positives and minimizing false negatives.
- Insight 4: The model might be overfitting on the training data due to the significant gap between training and test metrics. This could lead to lower performance on unseen data.
